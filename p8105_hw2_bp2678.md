\#Question 2

Mr Trash wheel; clean data set

``` r
mr_trash_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("Data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
  sheet = 1, range = "A2:N586") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(homes_power = (weight_tons*500/30),
        trash_df = "mr_trash", 
        year = as.numeric(year)) |>
  relocate(trash_df)
```

Professor Trash Wheel; clean data set

``` r
Professor_trash_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("Data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
  sheet = 2, range = "A2:M108") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(homes_power = (weight_tons*500/30),
         trash_df = "professor_trash") |>
  relocate(trash_df)
```

Gwynnda Trash Wheel; clean data set

``` r
Gwynndar_trash_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("Data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
  sheet = 4, range = "A2:L157") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(homes_power = (weight_tons*500/30),
         trash_df = "Gwynndar_trash") |>
  relocate(trash_df)
Gwynndar_Cigs_butt = Gwynndar_trash_df[1,10] + Gwynndar_trash_df[2,10] + Gwynndar_trash_df[3,10] + Gwynndar_trash_df[4,10] + Gwynndar_trash_df[5,10]
```

Total of all the trash wheel

``` r
Total_trash_df =
  bind_rows(Gwynndar_trash_df, Professor_trash_df, mr_trash_df)
```

In the dataset of Mr. Trash Wheel, it had three different data set for
Mr. Trash Wheel, Professor Trash Wheel, and Gwnnda Trash wheel. In those
three data set they had a total observation of 846. Professor Trash
Wheel had a total of 216.26 tons collected and Gwynnda collected a total
of 16300 cigarette butts in July 2021.

\#Question 3

clean and maipulate baseline mci dataset

``` r
baseline_mci_df = 
  read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    sex = recode(
      sex,
      `1` = "male",
      `0` = "female")) |>
  mutate(
  apoe4 = recode(
    apoe4,
    `1` = "carrier",
    `0` = "non-carrier")) |>
 filter(age_at_onset > current_age | age_at_onset == '.')
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): Age at onset
    ## dbl (5): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
devloping =
  filter(baseline_mci_df, age_at_onset != '.')

carriers =
  filter(baseline_mci_df, apoe4 == "carrier")
```

For this process we had to read the data and with the funciton read_csv
and from there we had to clean the data and change some of the
variables. Some of the imporant variables were id, sex, apoe4 and age of
onsent. Orignally there were 483 particpants that were in the study,
however only 479 met the requirment. The average age is 65.0286013and
the percentage of women who has the apoe4 gene is 30.0626305

clean and maipulate amyloid mci dataset

``` r
amyloid_mci_df = 
  read_csv("data/mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  rename("time_0" = baseline,
         "id" = study_id) |>
  pivot_longer(
    time_0:time_8,
    names_to = "time",
    values_to = "amyloid_amount"
  )
```

    ## Rows: 487 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (5): Baseline, Time 2, Time 4, Time 6, Time 8
    ## dbl (1): Study ID
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

For this process it was similar to what we did with the baseline. We
read the file from our folder and cleaned it up. We used pivot function
to be able to rename the varibles.

To see if there are any single particpants that only show up once

``` r
mci_single = 
  anti_join(baseline_mci_df, amyloid_mci_df, by = "id")
```

When looking at both data sets it shows only 8 particpants that show up
on one or the other but not both. The 8 participants are 14,
49,92,179,268,304,389,412.

``` r
mci_combined =
  inner_join (baseline_mci_df, amyloid_mci_df, by = "id")
```

when combining both data sets there are 2355 rows and 8 columns.It has
variables like id, sex, apoe4, amyloid_amount.
